# Microgrids with market power and limited regulation in developing countries: A focus on household economic surplus

## Project description
The model proposed in this repository, and its corresponding paper, are part of a project titled "From Off-grid Solar PV Systems to Microgrids in Lebanon". 

### Context
Under the instability and unavailability of their national grid, consumers in developing countries have invested in their own generation solutions. These commonly include a neighborhood diesel generator serving a grid parallel to the national one (microgrid), and household rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Such setups have their shortcomings. The owner of the neighborhood diesel generator, referred to as the diesel generator company (DGC), has uncontested market power over the microgrid: it decides on the access, grid availability, investments and tariffs within the microgrid under limited regulatory oversight. Moreover, household PV-owners suffer from the intermittent nature of their renewable systems, wasting excess generation potential during hours of high solar capacity factors.

### Purpose and research questions
We investigate the feasibility and impact of introducing renewable energy to the microgrid through a DGC-owned PV and battery system, as well as feed-in from household PV owners' (prosumer) electric surplus. Specifically, we ask:
- Under which limited policies is the DGC incentivized to introduce renewable energy in the microgrid?
- For which of such policies is the household economic surplus (HES) maximized?
- What are the effects of different constraints, such as budget and minimum renewable energy target, on the microgrid?

### Data and Case Study
This model is applied to the case of a microgrid in Deir Qanoun Ennaher, South Lebanon. Data has been collected [...]

## Repository description
This repository presents the code for a bi-level game theoretical model, with a weak regulator maximizing HES at the first level, and the profit-maximizing DGC at the second. 
The `main` branch of the repository is structured as follows:
